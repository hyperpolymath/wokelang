== Overview

WokeLang is a programming language designed with human values at its core. It prioritizes:

* **Consent** - Every sensitive operation requires explicit permission
* **Gratitude** - Attribution is a first-class language feature
* **Emotional Context** - Annotate code with intent and mood
* **Readability** - Natural language-style syntax
* **Safety** - Gentle error handling by default

== Quick Start

=== Installation

[source,bash]
----
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hyperpolymath/wokelang.git
cd wokelang

# Build with Cargo
cargo build --release

# Run the REPL
./target/release/woke
----

=== Hello World

[source,wokelang]
----
thanks to {
    "You" -> "For trying WokeLang!";
}

to main() {
    print("Hello, World!");
}
----

=== Key Features Demo

[source,wokelang]
----
// Consent-based operations
only if okay "camera_access" {
    remember photo = takePhoto();
}

// Gratitude attribution
thanks to {
    "Alice" -> "Algorithm design";
    "Bob" -> "Performance optimization";
}

// Emotional annotations
@cautious
to deleteUserData(userId: String) {
    // Sensitive operation
}

// Natural language syntax
repeat 5 times {
    print("Hello!");
}

when temperature > 100 {
    complain "It's too hot!";
}

// Safe error handling
attempt safely {
    remember data = fetchData();
} or reassure "We'll try again later";

// Pattern matching
decide based on mood {
    "happy" -> { celebrate(); }
    "sad" -> { comfort(); }
    _ -> { acknowledge(); }
}
----

== Language Concepts

=== Consent System

WokeLang requires explicit consent for sensitive operations:

[source,wokelang]
----
only if okay "file_access" {
    remember contents = readFile("data.txt");
}
----

=== Gratitude

Built-in attribution system:

[source,wokelang]
----
thanks to {
    "Rust Community" -> "For amazing tooling";
    "Contributors" -> "For making this possible";
}
----

=== Emote Tags

Annotate functions with emotional context:

[source,wokelang]
----
@enthusiastic
to celebrate() { /* ... */ }

@cautious
to handleSensitiveData() { /* ... */ }

@experimental
to tryNewApproach() { /* ... */ }
----

=== Workers (Concurrency)

Background task execution:

[source,wokelang]
----
worker dataProcessor {
    remember data = fetchData();
    processInBackground(data);
}

spawn worker dataProcessor;
----
