# Gratitude System

WokeLang's gratitude system makes attribution and acknowledgment first-class language features.

---

## Philosophy

The gratitude system reflects WokeLang's core value: **acknowledging contributions**. Code doesn't exist in isolation—it builds on the work of others. The gratitude system makes this visible and intentional.

---

## Gratitude Blocks

### Syntax

```wokelang
thanks to {
    "Contributor/Project" → "Reason for gratitude";
    "Another Contributor" → "Their contribution";
}
```

### Example

```wokelang
thanks to {
    "Rust Community" → "For amazing systems programming tools";
    "Open Source Contributors" → "For countless hours of work";
    "My Mentors" → "For teaching me to code with care";
}

to main() {
    print("Hello, World!");
}
```

---

## Gratitude Expressions

Express gratitude inline within code:

```wokelang
to processData(data: String) {
    remember result = thanks("Data Processing Team");

    // Process the data with appreciation
    transform(data);

    give back result;
}
```

---

## Use Cases

### Project-Level Gratitude

At the top of your main file:

```wokelang
thanks to {
    "Language Designers" → "For creating WokeLang";
    "Algorithm Authors" → "For the sorting algorithm used here";
    "testers" → "For finding bugs before users did";
}
```

### Library Gratitude

When using external code:

```wokelang
thanks to {
    "lodash maintainers" → "For utility functions";
    "date-fns team" → "For date handling";
}

use std.collections;
use external.datelib;
```

### Feature-Level Gratitude

Acknowledge specific contributions:

```wokelang
// This algorithm is based on work by Dr. Smith
thanks to {
    "Dr. Jane Smith" → "For the efficient sorting algorithm in her 2023 paper";
}

to quickSort(arr: [Int]) → [Int] {
    // Implementation based on Dr. Smith's research
    ...
}
```

### Runtime Gratitude

Express gratitude during execution:

```wokelang
to main() {
    print("Starting application...");

    // Log gratitude at runtime
    remember credit = thanks("Open Source Community");

    print("Application powered by open source");
}
```

---

## Gratitude Metadata

### Planned Features

```wokelang
thanks to {
    "Project A" → {
        reason: "Core algorithms",
        url: "https://github.com/project-a",
        license: "MIT"
    };

    "Person B" → {
        reason: "Code review",
        contribution_date: "2024-01-15"
    };
}
```

---

## Combining with Emote Tags

```wokelang
@happy
thanks to {
    "Community" → "For wonderful support";
}

@important
to main() {
    hello "Starting with gratitude";

    // The program runs with acknowledged dependencies
    runApplication();

    goodbye "Thanks for using this software";
}
```

---

## Gratitude Reports

### Planned Feature: Gratitude Export

```bash
# Generate gratitude report
woke gratitude --format=markdown > ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md

# Generate as JSON
woke gratitude --format=json > gratitude.json
```

### Example Output

```markdown
# Acknowledgments

This project gratefully acknowledges:

## Dependencies
- **Rust Community** - For amazing systems programming tools
- **Open Source Contributors** - For countless hours of work

## Individuals
- **My Mentors** - For teaching me to code with care

Generated by WokeLang v0.1.0
```

---

## Integration with Package Management (Planned)

```toml
# woke.toml
[package]
name = "my-app"
version = "1.0.0"

[gratitude]
auto-include-dependencies = true
custom = [
    { name = "Dr. Smith", reason = "Algorithm research" }
]
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific

```wokelang
// Good: Specific acknowledgment
thanks to {
    "React Team" → "For the component architecture pattern";
}

// Less helpful: Vague
thanks to {
    "Everyone" → "For everything";
}
```

### 2. Include Context

```wokelang
thanks to {
    "MDN Web Docs" → "For comprehensive JavaScript reference (consulted 2024)";
    "Stack Overflow" → "For the regex solution in parseEmail()";
}
```

### 3. Update Regularly

Keep gratitude blocks current as your project evolves.

### 4. Acknowledge All Contributions

```wokelang
thanks to {
    // Code contributions
    "Core Team" → "For implementation";

    // Non-code contributions
    "Documentation Team" → "For clear guides";
    "Translators" → "For i18n support";
    "Testers" → "For quality assurance";
    "Users" → "For valuable feedback";
}
```

---

## Gratitude in the REPL

```
woke> thanks("Helpful colleague")
[thanks] Helpful colleague
()

woke> :gratitude
Current session gratitude:
  - Helpful colleague
```

---

## Implementation

### Current Implementation

```rust
// In parser
TopLevelItem::GratitudeBlock(GratitudeBlock {
    entries: Vec<(String, String)>,
})

// In interpreter
fn execute_gratitude(&mut self, block: &GratitudeBlock) -> Result<()> {
    for (name, reason) in &block.entries {
        self.print(&format!("[gratitude] {} - {}", name, reason));
    }
    Ok(())
}

// Gratitude expression
Expr::Gratitude(msg) => {
    self.print(&format!("[thanks] {}", msg));
    Ok(Value::Unit)
}
```

---

## Cultural Significance

The gratitude system acknowledges that:

1. **Software is collaborative** - No code exists in isolation
2. **Attribution matters** - Credit should be visible
3. **Gratitude is healthy** - Acknowledging help improves culture
4. **History is valuable** - Understanding origins helps maintenance

---

## Example: Complete Program

```wokelang
// A complete WokeLang program with gratitude

thanks to {
    "WokeLang Team" → "For this wonderful language";
    "Tutorial Authors" → "For teaching me the basics";
    "Coffee" → "For keeping me awake";
}

#care on;

@happy
to main() {
    hello "Starting with gratitude";

    remember message = buildMessage();
    print(message);

    // Express runtime gratitude
    thanks("Users everywhere");

    goodbye "Thanks for running this program";
}

to buildMessage() → String {
    give back "Hello from a grateful program!";
}
```

Output:
```
[gratitude] WokeLang Team - For this wonderful language
[gratitude] Tutorial Authors - For teaching me the basics
[gratitude] Coffee - For keeping me awake
[hello] Starting with gratitude
Hello from a grateful program!
[thanks] Users everywhere
[goodbye] Thanks for running this program
```
