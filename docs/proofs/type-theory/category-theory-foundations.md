# Category Theory Foundations for WokeLang

This document provides the category-theoretic foundations underlying WokeLang's type system and semantics.

## 1. Categories and Types

### 1.1 The Category of Types

WokeLang types form a category **WokeType** where:

- **Objects:** Types (Int, Float, String, Bool, Unit, [τ], Maybe τ, Result[τ,ε], (τ₁,...,τₙ) → τ)
- **Morphisms:** Type-preserving functions (terms of function type)
- **Identity:** λx.x : τ → τ
- **Composition:** (g ∘ f)(x) = g(f(x))

### 1.2 Categorical Constructs

#### 1.2.1 Terminal Object

```
Unit (𝟙) is the terminal object:
∀τ. ∃! unit : τ → Unit
```

The unique morphism to Unit is `λ_.unit`.

#### 1.2.2 Initial Object

```
⊥ (bottom/void) is the initial object:
∀τ. ∃! absurd : ⊥ → τ
```

WokeLang doesn't have an explicit void type, but runtime errors can be viewed as ⊥.

#### 1.2.3 Products

```
τ₁ × τ₂ = { x: τ₁, y: τ₂ } (record types)
π₁ : τ₁ × τ₂ → τ₁
π₂ : τ₁ × τ₂ → τ₂
⟨f, g⟩ : σ → τ₁ × τ₂ when f : σ → τ₁ and g : σ → τ₂
```

#### 1.2.4 Coproducts

```
τ₁ + τ₂ = Variant1(τ₁) | Variant2(τ₂) (sum types)
ι₁ : τ₁ → τ₁ + τ₂
ι₂ : τ₂ → τ₁ + τ₂
[f, g] : τ₁ + τ₂ → σ when f : τ₁ → σ and g : τ₂ → σ
```

#### 1.2.5 Exponentials

```
τ₂^τ₁ = τ₁ → τ₂ (function types)
eval : (τ₂^τ₁) × τ₁ → τ₂
curry : (σ × τ₁ → τ₂) → (σ → τ₂^τ₁)
```

**Theorem 1.1:** WokeType is a cartesian closed category (CCC).

## 2. Functors

### 2.1 The Array Functor

`[-] : WokeType → WokeType` is a functor:

```
Objects: τ ↦ [τ]
Morphisms: (f : τ₁ → τ₂) ↦ (map f : [τ₁] → [τ₂])

Functor Laws:
  map id = id
  map (g ∘ f) = map g ∘ map f
```

### 2.2 The Maybe Functor

`Maybe : WokeType → WokeType` is a functor:

```
Objects: τ ↦ Maybe τ
Morphisms: (f : τ₁ → τ₂) ↦ (fmap f : Maybe τ₁ → Maybe τ₂)
  where fmap f Nothing = Nothing
        fmap f (Just x) = Just (f x)

Functor Laws:
  fmap id = id
  fmap (g ∘ f) = fmap g ∘ fmap f
```

### 2.3 The Result Functor

For fixed error type ε, `Result[-, ε] : WokeType → WokeType` is a functor:

```
Objects: τ ↦ Result[τ, ε]
Morphisms: (f : τ₁ → τ₂) ↦ (fmap f : Result[τ₁, ε] → Result[τ₂, ε])
  where fmap f (Oops e) = Oops e
        fmap f (Okay x) = Okay (f x)
```

---

## 3. Monads

### 3.1 The Maybe Monad

Maybe forms a monad with:

```
η (return) : τ → Maybe τ
η x = Just x

μ (join) : Maybe (Maybe τ) → Maybe τ
μ Nothing = Nothing
μ (Just Nothing) = Nothing
μ (Just (Just x)) = Just x

(>>=) : Maybe τ₁ → (τ₁ → Maybe τ₂) → Maybe τ₂
Nothing >>= f = Nothing
Just x >>= f = f x
```

**Monad Laws:**
```
η x >>= f = f x                    (left identity)
m >>= η = m                        (right identity)
(m >>= f) >>= g = m >>= (λx. f x >>= g)   (associativity)
```

### 3.2 The Result Monad

Result[τ, ε] forms a monad for fixed ε:

```
η : τ → Result[τ, ε]
η x = Okay x

(>>=) : Result[τ₁, ε] → (τ₁ → Result[τ₂, ε]) → Result[τ₂, ε]
Oops e >>= f = Oops e
Okay x >>= f = f x
```

This is the basis for `attempt safely` and the `?` operator.

### 3.3 The State Monad

The interpreter can be viewed through the State monad:

```
State s a = s → (a, s)

η x = λs. (x, s)
m >>= f = λs. let (a, s') = m s in f a s'
```

Where s = (Environment, Consent, FunctionStore).

### 3.4 The Consent Monad

We can define a Consent monad:

```
Consent a = ConsentState → (a + Denied, ConsentState)

η x = λc. (Okay x, c)
m >>= f = λc.
    let (r, c') = m c in
    case r of
        Oops e → (Oops e, c')
        Okay a → f a c'
```

### 3.5 Monad Transformers

Complex effects combine via transformers:

```
ExceptT ε (StateT s IO) a
= s → IO (Either ε a, s)
```

For WokeLang:
```
WokeM a = ConsentT (ResultT String (StateT Env IO)) a
```

## 4. Algebraic Data Types

### 4.1 Polynomial Functors

WokeLang ADTs are polynomial functors:

```
data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)

ListF a x = 1 + a × x
List a = μx. ListF a x = μx. 1 + a × x
```

### 4.2 Initial Algebras

**Definition:** An F-algebra is a pair (A, α : F A → A).

**Definition:** An initial F-algebra is an F-algebra (μF, in : F(μF) → μF) such that for any F-algebra (A, α), there exists a unique morphism (catamorphism) ⦇α⦈ : μF → A.

```
         F ⦇α⦈
F(μF) ────────→ F A
  │               │
in│               │α
  ↓               ↓
 μF ─────────→ A
        ⦇α⦈
```

### 4.3 Catamorphisms (Folds)

For List:
```
foldr : (a → b → b) → b → [a] → b
foldr f z [] = z
foldr f z (x:xs) = f x (foldr f z xs)
```

This is the catamorphism for the List functor.

## 5. Natural Transformations

### 5.1 Definition

A natural transformation η : F ⟹ G between functors F, G : C → D is a family of morphisms:

```
ηₐ : F(A) → G(A)
```

Such that for all f : A → B:
```
G(f) ∘ ηₐ = η_B ∘ F(f)
```

### 5.2 Examples in WokeLang

#### Maybe to Result

```
maybeToResult : ∀τ ε. Maybe τ → Result[τ, ε]
maybeToResult Nothing = Oops "Nothing"
maybeToResult (Just x) = Okay x
```

#### Array to Maybe

```
headMaybe : ∀τ. [τ] → Maybe τ
headMaybe [] = Nothing
headMaybe (x:_) = Just x
```

## 6. Adjunctions

### 6.1 Free-Forgetful Adjunction

The relationship between WokeLang and untyped evaluation:

```
Free : Set → WokeType
Forgetful : WokeType → Set

Free ⊣ Forgetful
```

### 6.2 Currying Adjunction

```
- × A ⊣ (-)^A

Hom(B × A, C) ≅ Hom(B, C^A)
```

This is the basis for curry/uncurry:

```
curry : ((A × B) → C) → (A → (B → C))
uncurry : (A → (B → C)) → ((A × B) → C)
```

---

## 7. Limits and Colimits

### 7.1 Limits

**Theorem 7.1:** WokeType has all finite limits.

- Products: Record types
- Equalizers: Subtyping (limited)
- Pullbacks: Intersection types (not implemented)

### 7.2 Colimits

**Theorem 7.2:** WokeType has all finite colimits.

- Coproducts: Sum types (enums)
- Coequalizers: Quotient types (not implemented)
- Pushouts: (not implemented)

---

## 8. Topos Structure

### 8.1 Subobject Classifier

If WokeLang had a Bool type acting as Ω:

```
true : 1 → Bool
χₘ : A → Bool (characteristic function of subobject m)
```

For predicate P on type A:
```
{ x : A | P(x) } ←→ P : A → Bool
```

### 8.2 Power Objects

```
℘(A) = A → Bool
```

Not directly representable in WokeLang without dependent types.

---

## 9. Yoneda Lemma

### 9.1 Statement

For any functor F : C → Set and object A in C:

```
Nat(Hom(A, -), F) ≅ F(A)
```

### 9.2 Application to Types

For WokeLang types:
```
∀R. (τ → R) → F R ≅ F τ
```

This underlies continuation-passing style transformations.

---

## 10. Semantics Categories

### 10.1 The Category of Domains

For denotational semantics:

- **Objects:** CPOs (complete partial orders) with ⊥
- **Morphisms:** Continuous (Scott-continuous) functions
- **Limits:** Bilimits exist for domain equations

### 10.2 Solving Domain Equations

```
Value ≅ Int + Float + String + Bool + 1 + Value* + (Value + String) + (Value →ᶜ Value⊥)
```

Solved using:
1. Bilimit construction
2. Information systems
3. Inverse limit construction

---

## 11. Linear and Affine Types (Future)

### 11.1 Linear Logic Interpretation

Future WokeLang could add linear types:

```
τ ⊗ σ : Linear tensor (both consumed)
τ & σ : Additive conjunction (choose one)
τ ⊕ σ : Additive disjunction (sum type)
!τ : Of course (unlimited use)
```

### 11.2 Relevance to Resources

Linear types ensure resources (like Result values) are used exactly once:

```
remember r : !Result[A, E] = operation();
// r must be matched/unwrapped exactly once
```
